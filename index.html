    <h3>What is the sale all about?</h3>
    <p>The 4-H and livestock sale at the Bonneville County Fair is where youth involved in market animal projects sell their animals. All sale proceeds directly benefit individual 4-H and FFA members. Many of these youth put their earnings toward college tuition or use the money to help with raising their animals and purchasing new ones for the following year. It is a big way to show your support to the youth who have invested time and money into learning real life skills.</p>

    <h3>When you purchase a 4-H or FFA animal at the sale...</h3>
    <p>You're investing in a high-quality product. Market animals are raised in the best conditions and fed the best feed available to ensure top quality.</p>

    <h3>How does the sale work?</h3>
    <p><span class="important">Pre-registration is encouraged.</span></p>
    <p>On the day of the sale, the sale arena will open at (time). You’ll sign up to bid in the arena, receive a numbered card, and select your preferred butcher and slaughterhouse.</p>

    <h3>OK, I’m the high bidder—now what?</h3>
    <p>You’ll receive an invoice from the Sale Committee. Please note that processing costs are separate from the auction purchase. Typically, butchers will include a slaughter fee and a per-pound cut and wrap fee in the final processing bill. After the sale, all market animals are shipped to local processors for grading, and the carcasses are delivered to your butcher for cutting and wrapping. Be sure to coordinate with your butcher if you need transport for the meat.</p>

    <h3>Buyer’s Options:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>If you want the whole animal:</strong> You’re responsible for both purchasing and processing costs. If you prefer to pay immediately after the sale, you can avoid being billed later.</li>
        <li><strong>You can resell your purchase:</strong> If you prefer, you can sign your purchase back to the 4-H and FFA Committee for resale. These animals will be sold at the current market price, and you’ll only be billed for the difference between your bid and that price.</li>
        <li><strong>Tax-deductible purchase:</strong> If you wish, you can buy an animal as a charitable donation or a goodwill gift.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymous purchases:</strong> Purchases can be made anonymously.</li>
        <li><strong>Can’t attend the sale?</strong> If you can’t make it, a proxy buyer can help. </li>
    </ul>
